" State whether the following statements are true or false. Give reasons for your answers. (i) Every natural number is a whole number.

The statement is true since the collection of whole numbers contains all natural numbers. (ii) Every integer is a whole number.

No, the statement is false, as integers may be negative but whole numbers are always positive.

(iii) Every rational number is a whole number.

No, the statement is false, as rational numbers may be fractional but whole numbers may not be.",https://edusaint.com/ncert-solutions-for-class-9th/ncert-solutions-for-class-9th-maths-chapter-wise-free/ncert-solutions-for-class-9th-maths-chapter-1-number-system/
" 1.    Check whether the following are quadratic equations:
(i) (x + 1)2 = 2(x – 3)
(ii) x2 – 2x = (–2)(3 – x)
(iii) (x – 2)(x + 1) = (x – 1)(x + 3)
(iv) (x – 3)(2x + 1) = x(x + 5)
 (v) (2x – 1) (x – 3) – (x + 5) (x – 1)
(vi) x2 + 3x +1 = (x – 2)2
(vii) (x + 2)3 = 2x(x2 – 1)
